**Integration**

I attempted to set up the required environment locally. I have successfully set up the deployment with MongoDB as the datastore, and the API is responding by fetching details from MongoDB., but I encountered challenges completing the following components
 - Load Balancer
 - Issuer (let's encrypt)
 - Certificate Manager - clients.api.deltacapita.com
