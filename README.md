**Integration**

I attempted to set up the required environment locally for testing purposes. The API is operational and responding successfully, but I encountered challenges completing the following components due to limitations of a local setup
 - Load Balancer
 - Issuer (let's encrypt)
 - Certificate Manager - clients.api.deltacapita.com
